#  - this is a 2015 paper that did linear detrending... only read 98 times and cited 0 times.... idk that does not sounds great to me!

#  - moving window linear regression for the temp data
#  - linear regression for the CO2 growth rate

#  - this is the paper used the linearly weight moving average gradient to remove the trend... aka this is what i think that I did

#  - a version of the technical report that was actually submited to a journal with pyhsical 
#    computer examples idk 
#   - omg they do the 2 * sigma approach too!! that might be a gmae changer
